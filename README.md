# State of Libre Graphics 2026

The opening presentation at Libre Graphics Meeting is “State of Libre Graphics,” an update from the many software, curation publication and umbrella projects of our Libre Graphics community.

Each project should submit in the respective project directory:

- Name of project, project logo/branding, and a short one or two sentence description of the project.
- A title slide/hero shot and/or picture of the software in use, preferably size 1920x1080.
    - If feel the need for more images to include in the presentation, feel free.
- Changes/changelog in the last year, and plans/roadmap for the future.
- Speaker notes for any additional information or specifications you want me to say.

The notes preferably should be in .txt or .md (Markdown) format, images preferably in .png/.jpg/.webp format. Feel free to include other files if necessary such as video (although include as external link), gifs, etc... No proprietary file formats!

Please also label your images and slides if necessary using the filename with numbers.

*You know what would be really cool? If you make your slides using your project's software!*   
-> if because of this the slide dimensions or format deviates from the norm, that's fine, I'll adapt it into the presentation

This repository contains a [sample-project](sample-project/) directory with a set of empty files that you can build upon.

If you're wondering what you should put on the slides, you can watch the [State of Libre Graphics 2025](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2025/program/state_of_libre_graphics/) or browse through the [2025 repository](https://github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/state-of-lg-2025).

For projects focused on video/animation, an up to 60 seconds video/animation with audio is a good alternative to the slides 1 and 2. If you choose this option, please upload the video somewhere and provide an URL for fetching it in the txt/md file.

**How to submit your slides?**

Please provide your project's slides through a pull request to this repository or add them to an issue ticket.

Content should be submitted before **April 12 2026**. However, **THE EARLIER THE BETTER** (and easier)! Thanks!

If you know of any other libre-graphics projects that should be included, please mention in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/state-of-lg-2026/issues/1)! (still finishing compiling the list, wip)
