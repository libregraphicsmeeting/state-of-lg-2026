# State of Libre Graphics 2026
Every year, the [Libre Graphics Meeting](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org) starts with an opening presentation called the **State of Libre Graphics**, an update from the many software, curation publication and umbrella projects of our Libre Graphics community.

## Submission Details:
*You know what would be really cool? Make you slides using your project's software!*
- If because of this the slide dimensions or format deviates from the norm, that's completely fine, I'll adapt it into the presentation. Video submissions should aim to be under 1 min, definitely under 1.5 min.

Each project should submit in the respective project directory:
- name of project, project logo/branding, further links if you want, and a short one or two sentence description of the project
- A title slide/hero shot and/or picture of the software in use.
    - If need more images, feel free
- Changes/changelog in the last year
- Plans/roadmap for the future
- Speaker notes in a markdown file. 
    - Whatever is listed in there will be read aloud (avoid long run-on texts)
    - Mark which text should be read with which slide.
- Presence at LGM
    - If there are members of your project attending LGM, feel free to list them here so people can find you.
    - If you have a talk or workshop at LGM about your project, feel to add a mention here

The submission should end up looking something similar to this:
```
.
└── project name folder/
    ├── project.md
    │   ├── Name
    │   ├── Description of Project
    │   ├── Further Links
    │   ├── Slide 0 - title slide
    │   │   └── Slide 0 speaker notes
    │   ├── Slide 1 - Changelog
    │   │   └── Slide 1 speaker notes
    │   ├── Slide 2 - Roadmap/Future
    │   │   └── Slide 2 speaker notes
    │   └── Presence at LGM
    ├── Slide 0.png
    ├── Slide 1.jpg
    ├── Slide 2.png
    └── logo.svg
```
